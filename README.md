This "Hello Word" app is the fifth effort at learning the basics of the MEAN application stack. In this revision, I change up the mobile UI framework (yet again). 

_Mobile Angular UI_

Not knowing the underlying Bootstrap 3 framework used by Mobile Angular UI, I tried to use it from the examples that they provided. In doing so, I started to run into limitaitons, e.g., fought the navbar for some time.

_Topcoat_

After starting looking around, I bumped into another UI framework, Topcoat that looked promising, e.g., no Javascript and what appeared to be a broad set of tools.  When I did all my developmen Firefox everything looked good, but then I tried running it on my Android brower (not even that old) and things started breaking.

_Bootstrap_

Being disappointed with what appeard to be the leading mobile UI that work with Angular JS (jQuery Mobile apparently does not play well with Angular JS), I decided it was time that I learned Bootstrap. With the 3.X release, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that even with no Javascript code, I was able to do most everything that I needed to build a fairly decent mobile user interface.

Figure that this is a good start.
